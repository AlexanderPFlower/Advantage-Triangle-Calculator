# Advantage-Triangle-Calculator

This program seeks to highlight how the logic of Paper, Scissors, Rock is found in both Pokémon and Fire Emblem (by no means am I the first to consider this).

main.py will demonstrate how they relate once we abstract from the names with numbers as replacement. So, instead of [paper, scissors, rock], [grass, water, fire], and [sword, axe, lance], we'll use [0,1,2].

Afterwards, those numbers are then compared. Notes on how to possibly approach the logic are presented to provide a kind of tutorial for beginners, along with explaining my thought process. This generally can be seen as taking a very wide perspective to produce a working, albeit simplistic code. A refactoring of the code is presented afterwards.

Keep in mind that there is much more to Pokémon and Fire Emblem.

Pokémon, in a way, is like an extension of paper, scissors, rock; they added many types over the years and other factors that influence each other in various ways.

Fire Emblem has a Battle Accuracy logic, wherein the 'rock, paper, scissors' logic is but one factor in calculating the Battle Accuracy percentage.

Don't quote me on that! I'm not an expert on either game and only sought to know just enough to explain the gist of how both games build up from paper, scissors, rock!
